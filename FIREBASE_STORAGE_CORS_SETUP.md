# Firebase Storage CORS Setup Guide

## Problem
Your Flutter web app is experiencing CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) errors when trying to upload files to Firebase Storage. This is a common issue when running Flutter web apps that access Firebase Storage.

## Error Message
```
Access to XMLHttpRequest at 'https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/utkarsh-8cf54.firebasestorage.app/o?name=content%2F...' from origin 'http://localhost:64716' has been blocked by CORS policy: Response to preflight request doesn't pass access control check: It does not have HTTP ok status.
```

## Solutions

### Solution 1: Update Firebase Storage Security Rules

1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Select your project (`utkarsh-8cf54`)
3. Navigate to **Storage** → **Rules**
4. Update the rules to:

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service firebase.storage {
  match /b/{bucket}/o {
    // Allow authenticated users to upload content
    match /content/{fileName} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null;
      allow write: if request.auth != null;
    }
    
    // Allow read access to all authenticated users
    match /{allPaths=**} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null;
    }
  }
}
```

5. Click **Publish**

### Solution 2: Configure CORS for Firebase Storage

1. **Install Google Cloud SDK** (if not already installed):
   - Download from: https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install
   - Or use the installer for your OS

2. **Authenticate with Google Cloud**:
   ```bash
   gcloud auth login
   ```

3. **Set your project**:
   ```bash
   gcloud config set project utkarsh-8cf54
   ```

4. **Create a CORS configuration file** (`cors.json`):
   ```json
   [
     {
       "origin": ["*"],
       "method": ["GET", "POST", "PUT", "DELETE", "HEAD"],
       "maxAgeSeconds": 3600,
       "responseHeader": [
         "Content-Type", 
         "Authorization", 
         "Content-Length", 
         "User-Agent", 
         "x-goog-*"
       ]
     }
   ]
   ```

5. **Apply CORS configuration**:
   ```bash
   gsutil cors set cors.json gs://utkarsh-8cf54.appspot.com
   ```

   **Note**: Replace `utkarsh-8cf54.appspot.com` with your actual bucket name if different.

6. **Verify CORS is set**:
   ```bash
   gsutil cors get gs://utkarsh-8cf54.appspot.com
   ```

### Solution 3: Alternative - Use Firebase Functions (Advanced)

If CORS continues to be an issue, you can create a Firebase Function to handle uploads:

1. **Initialize Firebase Functions**:
   ```bash
   firebase init functions
   ```

2. **Create upload function** in `functions/index.js`:
   ```javascript
   const functions = require('firebase-functions');
   const admin = require('firebase-admin');
   admin.initializeApp();

   exports.uploadFile = functions.https.onCall(async (data, context) => {
     // Check if user is authenticated
     if (!context.auth) {
       throw new functions.https.HttpsError('unauthenticated', 'User must be authenticated');
     }

     // Handle file upload logic here
     // This bypasses CORS issues
   });
   ```

3. **Deploy the function**:
   ```bash
   firebase deploy --only functions
   ```

## Testing the Fix

1. **Restart your Flutter app** after making changes
2. **Try uploading a file** through the Content Management interface
3. **Check the browser console** for any remaining errors

## Common Issues and Troubleshooting

### Issue: "gsutil command not found"
- **Solution**: Install Google Cloud SDK
- **Alternative**: Use Firebase Console to manually set rules

### Issue: "Permission denied" when setting CORS
- **Solution**: Ensure you're authenticated and have the right permissions
- **Check**: Your account has Storage Admin role

### Issue: CORS still not working after setup
- **Solutions**:
  1. Wait a few minutes for changes to propagate
  2. Clear browser cache and cookies
  3. Check if you're using the correct bucket name
  4. Verify security rules are published

### Issue: Security rules too restrictive
- **Solution**: Temporarily use more permissive rules for testing:
  ```javascript
  rules_version = '2';
  service firebase.storage {
    match /b/{bucket}/o {
      match /{allPaths=**} {
        allow read, write: if true; // WARNING: Only for testing!
      }
    }
  }
  ```
  **Remember to restrict this for production!**

## Production Considerations

1. **Restrict CORS origins** to your actual domains instead of `"*"`
2. **Implement proper authentication** in security rules
3. **Set appropriate file size limits**
4. **Monitor storage usage** and costs
5. **Implement virus scanning** for uploaded files

## Alternative Workarounds

### For Development/Testing:
- Use the updated code that handles web platform differently
- Files will be stored as references in Firestore
- Full functionality requires CORS configuration

### For Production:
- Always configure CORS properly
- Use Firebase Storage for actual file storage
- Implement proper security measures

## Quick Test

After implementing the fixes, test with a small file:

1. Go to Admin Dashboard → Content Management
2. Select "Upload Content" tab
3. Choose a small PDF or text file
4. Fill in the form details
5. Click "Upload Content"

If successful, you should see a green success message. If CORS errors persist, double-check your configuration.
